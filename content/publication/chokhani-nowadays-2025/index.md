abstract: 'Purpose: This study aimed to understand how college-going young men and
  women in Bengaluru, India experience violence within dating relationships and their
  understanding of the role of gender in dating violence. Methods: In-depth interviews
  were conducted with 14 undergraduate students aged between 18-21 years old. The
  data were analyzed using the framework of Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis.
  Results: Five key themes emerged from participants’ accounts: (1) defining abuse,
  (2) experiencing abuse (3) impact of abuse (4) abuse is gendered and (5) abuse is
  multifaceted. The first theme identifies how definitions of abuse are ambiguous
  and context-specific while the second theme discusses how young adults experience
  abuse as feeling controlled, losing control or self-protection. The third theme
  highlights how abuse causes distress but can also invoke coping while the fourth
  theme discusses the unique gender dynamics in abuse. Finally, the fifth theme identifies
  the perceived role of individual and community-level efforts in preventing abuse.
  Conclusions: Violence is experienced as a complex and distressing part of dating
  relationships. The phenomenological insights gained from the study underscore the
  need for early identification and have implications for developing dating violence
  interventions in colleges and for future research in similar contexts.'
