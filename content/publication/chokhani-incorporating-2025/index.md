abstract: Purpose This study aimed to understand whether incorporating wellbeing as
  another dimension within general factor models of mental health is (a) feasible
  and (b) useful. Methods Data from two time points (Year 7 and Year 9) for 15258
  adolescents who participated in the HeadStart programme in England was used. In
  Stage 1, we used structural equation modelling on time point 1 data to test different
  latent variable models incorporating psychopathology and wellbeing dimensions. In
  Stage 2, we tested whether the latent factors identified in Stage 1 significantly
  predicted impairment at time point 2. Results A general factor model incorporating
  a shared underlying dimension between (lack of) wellbeing and psychopathology as
  well as unique specific factors had good fit to the data at Stage 1. Further, although
  both general factor models with and without wellbeing fit the data well at Stage
  1, only the general factor model with wellbeing met all required fit thresholds
  when regressions to predict impairment were added in. The model without any general
  factor (correlated factors model) met pre-defined fit thresholds but had lower fit
  indices. Conclusion The incorporation of wellbeing into general factor models may
  help represent more nuanced mental health states and may be useful in predicting
  future functional states, however such a model needs further replication with comprehensive
  measures and comparison with alternative models to verify its validity and utility.
